Bugs in v1 hardware:
Don't use 0204 parts. They're annoyingly tiny. 1206 for everything. 
The caps are OK 0805
The footprint for the diode is too big, it's only slightly bigger than 1206. 
The footprint for the switch needs the leg contacts moved in by half their length towards the switch
Via for the heat sink for the motor drivers needs to not be under the ESP8266
Connectorize battery
Needs jumper to connect CH_PD high (for running) or low (for flashing). 
 - SMD pads?
Needs jumper from GPIO15 to ground to talk serial to it for AT commands. 
 - GPIO15 is what I was going to use for one of the fault sensing lines
 - What workflow do I want? Probably something like WiFi/Arduino
   - Reflash over wifi?
   - Motor commands?

Assembly pointers:
Get you some fine-point tweezers for great good

Ideological bugs:
Off is not where you think it is on the switch (on is towards the battery)
- Label on the PCB
Surface mount ESP8266 has no idiot lights, add one so I can tell when it is on
Add another light to an unused GPIO for debugging
Any reason I shouldn't have all pull-ups be one value (have some 10k and some 1k)?
