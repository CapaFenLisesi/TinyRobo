5/19/17
- Started playing with single camera
  - Structure sensor is being odd, rostopic hz didn't get anything from depth_registered
  - It only uses depth, not depth_registered, because it doesn't have RGB images

5/22/17

	- Ray is doing automatic calibration of the scooter
	- Marshall is working on building Thing 1
- Automatic cloud registration with appropriate sensor activation
- Expense report for Singapore


6/12/17
- Finished registered cloud provider
- Can we get the RGB images in the same plane as well, for laser finding?
	- Otherwise, laser finder will have to be extended to two RGB images
- Lab meeting 
- Checked if subscribing to the RGB image turns the IR sensor on as well
- Expense report for Singapore trip

To Do:

6/13/17
- Test edits to active_sensing_driving
- Helped Siddharth fix a bad file system on his laptop
	- If you get "EXT4-fs (sda1): group descriptors corrupted!", boot with a liveCD, and do sudo mke2fs -n /dev/xxx to list the superblock backup locations, followed by sudo e2fsck -b block_number /dev/xxx using the first superblock backup number to restore the superblock. It will prompt you before fixing stuff, just hit y for everything. 

6/14/17
- Try to convert return path for arm to use obstacle-aware planner
- Try to troubleshoot arm kinematic problems
- Commit working stuff

6/15/17

	- have cloud_registration not check either sensor if it has no subscribers
	- have proxy unsub from cloud registration when not using it


6/20/17
- Scooter demo for Dave Kontak

6/21-25
- Finish virtual sensor node

6/27
- Fighting with the very old version of emerge on the baxter control PC to try to get wireless on the scooter. 
- Restore scooter image

6/28
- Just hook the scooter up to a switch
- Test controlling it with the laptop connected to the same switch
- Maybe put a switch in the box, so we could drive it around?

7/3,5,6
- Helped interns with finding stuff and scooter cam config
- Got rqt_graphprofiler working with Qt 5
- Tried to fix lack of USB ports on XPS system (front and one rear don't do anything)
	- Using USB hub starts running into bandwidth issues with cameras
- Reseated cards and RAM in XPS, hoping to reduce crashes
- Started slides for presentation to psych class


Wheelchair:

Gesture Experiment
- Add image of robot to recruitment poster
- Set up a single-page website with a map to the experiment location
- Post flyers

Swarm control software
- Write virtual network node
- Implement a simulation of attempting to vector towards a point, and doing wall follow to get around obstacles. Robots will have to have volume/area, so they don't just pile up in a point. Intent is to see what's a solid strategy for going somewhere with obstacle avoidance. 
- look for papers on follow-the-leader, ant mills in robots
- there are papers on developing a coordinate grid with only local sensing and messaging, get some references
- write a little sim to see if the spreading inhibition and member-count-based frame choice is a stable strategy for eventually having one coordinate frame dominate. Write a graphical output for it so it looks sweet, and for illustrating papers. 

Documentation/presentations
- Write presentation for ICRA
- Finish paper for HardwareX, including last revision of hardware





To Not Do:
- Put lubuntu on the vaio
	- Crashes on USB stick insertion, probably can't boot off USB anyway


Starting the rqt_graphprofiler
roscore
rosparam set enable_statistics true
rosrun rosprofiler rosprofiler
rosrun rosprofiler rosgrapher
roslaunch your stuff
rqt_graphprofiler


Wireless on the scooter:
The version of emerge on there is v. old, so installing a new version of emerge is blocked because of having an old version of emerge. This is a known problem with gentoo in general. Currently attempting to get the tarfile for the recent emerge, install that, upgrade it with itself. 

Attempting to get the url for the tarfile by visiting http://distfiles.gentoo.org/distfiles/ crashes firefox, so I got it with 

 wget http://distfiles.gentoo.org/distfiles/

Getting the new version of portage resulted in a python version fight. 

Installing things with either version of portage, old or new, results in it making output that looks like it's installing things, without actually doing the install.

Unfortunately, restoring the image of the baxter hard drive seems to have done something bad to the networking on the baxter. 

It's now using "stable network interface names" instead of net1 and net0

Somehow, /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules either wasn't included in the clonezilla backup, or got deleted. Either way, it's needed to configure the network interfaces to be named net1 and net0, which is in turn needed by everything else. 

I fixed it by scping the 70-persistent-net.rules off the working baxter and editing it. For future reference, the values are 

net0: 34:17:eb:af:2b:a5 <- Dell interface, or at least Dell vendor according to lookup
net1: 00:0a:f7:68:78:7e <- Broadcom, probably the network card
