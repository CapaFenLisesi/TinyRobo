I shouldn't have to write programs to fix other programs, the kicad devs should just not release busted-ass shit made of bad ideas. Until then, though...

rebuildfplib.py - reads https://github.com/KiCad and tries to build a footprint library, since the devs can break your install of KiCad by changing how things are organized in their development tools.
