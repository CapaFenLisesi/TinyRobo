\section{Motivation}

\section{Hardware}

ESP8266 module. 

Power supply

Motor driver

Potential for expansion over I2C (add expansion pads to next hardware rev, and correct I2C wiring)

Use a URL shortener to point to latest revision?

\section {Firmware}

Adaptation to underlying toy hardware. 

Should have software calibration \& hardware reset option (e.g. a IoT-style connection dialog that also includes a "motor calibrate" and "clear calibration" options.)

Motor speed translation from twist message should be brought into ROS, robots don't get a Twist. Board can't tell how motor speeds affect position, ROS/Camera system can.

\section{Software}

Virtual senses (neighbor sense and tape sense).

Not bound to TinyRobo hardware, so may be useful to other users of tabletop swarms. 

Automatic setup of robots on the network (need to figure out a faster scan method)
