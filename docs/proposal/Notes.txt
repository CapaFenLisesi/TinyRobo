This is a scratch file that I put stuff in when I remove it from the main paper. 

Don't expect it to be useful, or even to contain complete sentences. 

Motion "primitives" from Stupid Robot Tricks
Motion $\rightarrow$ moveArc, moveStop, moveForward, moveByRemoteControl, bumpMove

Orientation $\rightarrow$ orientForOrbit, orbitRobot, orientToRobot, matchHeadingToRobot, followRobot

Navigation $\rightarrow$ followTheLeader, orbitGroup, navigateGradient

Clustering $\rightarrow$ clusterOnSource, clusterWithBreadCrumbs, clusterIntoGroups

Dispersion $\rightarrow$ avoidRobot, avoidManyRobots, disperseFromSource, disperseFromLeaves, disperseUniformly

Utility $\rightarrow$ detectEdges

detectEdges is "detect if you are on the edge of the swarm" 

Utility classes are to be regarded with skepticism, they are like "miscelaneous" categories. 

$\Rightarrow$ iRobot swarm had directional IR signaling (quadrants) using signal strength to figure out range and bearing, so that's something I'll want to include or emulate in my system. 

$\Rightarrow$ I should probably include some form of charging that doesn't involve a lot of hands-on interaction with my robots. 

Computer is aware of meaning of gesture, locations of robots. 
Second assumption (global localization) may not hold. 
How can computer determine what programs or what parameters result in the completion of the task?

What are the tasks? Assume search and rescue domain, what are the tasks in USR? Search an area with good coverage. Report content of an area. Group at a location. Locate a specific resource. 

This could be situated at an intersection between planning and compiling, as the compilation might have to factor in elements of the known environment at the time of compilation. Since the actors are spatially situated, plans should incorporate spatial awareness. 

$\Rightarrow$ Why is almost everyone ignoring power supplies except as an afterthought? Not a computer science problem?
